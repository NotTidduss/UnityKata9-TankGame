Unity Kata #9 - Tank Game

What is a Tank Game?
 * control a tank with tank controls
	* movement goes only fowards and backwards
	* side movement rotates the tank
 * be in an arena with at least one more enemy tank
 * shoot each other

Flow:
	1) start game
	2) spawn in arena
	3) control tank, shoot eachother -> play game
	4) whoever gets hit first, loses
	5) simple result screen
	6) restart
	
ToDo:
	- Arena
	- Tank prefab
	- Projectile prefab
	- collision detection between projectiles and tanks
	- gameover functionality

Goals:
	- tank controls
	- work with particle effects
	- blow up an enemy tank
